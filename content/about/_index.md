Hey! I am Rajiv, a Master's student in Robotics, Systems, and Control at ETH Zürich. I am passionate about robotics, and I am currently learning about optimal control, robot dynamics, planning and decision making, and computer vision! Before this, I was a Software Developer at Amazon where I helped build systems that advertise exciting products to users on social media! I finished my undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan in Computer Engineering in May 2022.

At Michigan, I had the opportunity to do research at [ROAHM Lab] and implement control algorithms for a robot arm. I also was a member of the [UM Autonomous Robotic Vehicle][ARV] team and [Michigan Electric Racing (now M-Racing)][MER] teams. I also sang with the [Michigan Men's Glee Club][UMMGC] and [Michigan Sahana]

Outside of work, I enjoy playing tennis, singing music, and spending time outdoors! I also love to try out exciting recipes from TikTok!
