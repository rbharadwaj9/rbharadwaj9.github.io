<!--summary-->
Our team designed and fabricated a tendon-actuated hand mounted on a Franka Emika arm for teleoperation, and an autonomous object manipulation task. I was responsible for the base ROS 2 software, hardware interfacing, and developing an Action Chunking Transformer based Imitation Learning policy to perform pick-and-place tasks. I also helped develop a UI with safety checks to prevent hardware faults and accelerate data collection.

The project was recognized with **“Most Intuitive Software Design”**.
