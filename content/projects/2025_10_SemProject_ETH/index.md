<!--summary-->
This semester project focuses on enabling an ANYmal with a 6-DoF Arm to open and traverse different types of doors without task specific knowledge. Using student-teacher distillation, we distil the knowledge of task specific expert teachers, trained using PPO, into a single student policy. We build upon this formulation to explore methods to improve task specific feature extraction to improve learning performance.
