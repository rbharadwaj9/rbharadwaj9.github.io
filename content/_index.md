## Hi there! 👋

Hey, I am Rajiv!
I'm a Master's student in Robotics, Systems, and Control at ETH Zürich, combining a strong software background with a passion for robotics.<br>
My interests and coursework explore **Reinforcement Learning for Controls, Optimization Methods, Vision Algorithms, and Simulation**. I also find aerial robotics to be a fascinating area to explore!

I recently completed my semester project at the [Robotic Systems Lab](https://rsl.ethz.ch) where I explored RL and student-teacher distillation methods for whole-body loco-manipulation tasks.

Previously, I worked as Software Developer at Amazon, where I was responsible for building and scaling high-throughput systems that powered social media advertising for new products. During my time there, I also had the opportunity to mentor an intern, guiding her to successfully deliver a production-ready software component while ensuring a positive and impactful learning experience.

I finished my undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan in Computer Engineering in May 2022 with a focus in Robotics and AI. At Michigan, I had the opportunity to do research at [ROAHM Lab] and implement control algorithms for a robot arm. I also was a member of the [UM Autonomous Robotic Vehicle][ARV] team.

Outside of work, I love to play tennis, hike, and explore my creative side via singing (I sang with the [Michigan Men's Glee Club][UMMGC] and [Michigan Sahana])! I also love to try out exciting recipes from TikTok!

🚀 I'm currently **seeking internship opportunities** to dive deeper into real world applications for Reinforcement Learning methods.
